							<h2> Dez!!</h2>
							<par> Dez is a lovable pig who enjoys having his mom sing to him and playing with his pig brother and human brothers and sisters.  He will root for hours in the backyard looking for nuts and other fun things to eat.  When Dez was a young piglet, he was not able to use his hind legs, but with the wonderful love and care of his family and a kind veternarian, Dez is doing great and runs almost as fast as his pig brother, Cody.</par>

							<h2> Cody!!</h2>
							<par> Cody is full of personality and very curious.  He will be the first to try to open the door or to find a crafty way to get a little more food.  He loves being outside, running, and rooting around for anything and everything.  Cody loves to play with his pig brother Dez and his human brothers and sisters.  Cody has always been larger than Dez, and he likes to pretend like he is the big pig on campus.</par>
